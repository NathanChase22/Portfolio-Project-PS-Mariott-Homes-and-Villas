# Market, Users, Prototype

## Understand Your Market
*Provide links to the 3 websites you explored* 

- [Vrbo](https://www.vrbo.com)

- [AirBnb](https://www.airbnb.com)

- [HomeToGo](https://www.hometogo.com)

*Briefly explain why these websites are a relevant comparison* 

        The sites chosen are relevant because the first two, Vrbo and AirBnB, are highly popular home rental sites. Because they are popular, they likely reflect a good CX experience. Moreover unlike AirBnB, Vrbo was a brand created by Expedia Group, who prior to the boom in home rentals, already owned a signifant share of the online travel industry with Expedia. I wanted to see a product created by a company already established in another aspect of the travel industry trying to get a entrance into rapidly growing home rental. Since Marriott is trying to shift focus from their established niche of hotel chains to the online home rental market. Finally I looked at HomeToGo to see if there were any innovative practices by smaller sites being overshadowed by the dominance of AirBnB or Vrbo.

## Understand Your Users
*Write a short paragraph (50-100 words) describing the themes that emerged from the user research*

        The user research suggests that users have an underlying desire when first looking for rentals to start at broad vacation 'themes' such as 'beach' or 'mountains' rather than being immediately met with granular and location-based options. Users unfamiliar or unsure of their destination would find selectors based on particular destinations cumbersome rather than helpful. Survey data reinforces this finding, where most responding users knew the wanted vacation 'type' but not the destination. Having a quick and immediate menu for users to select destinations based on the type or theme of vacation will appeal to users of the researched sample population.
